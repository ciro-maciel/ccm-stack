description: Find what a change can break outside its own diff before it ships, and prove by running real code the one fact that makes it safe. Use for "what could this break", "is this safe to merge", "blast radius of X", or any small diff touching shared code, data shapes, APIs or configuration.

# Know what a change breaks

Listing the callers is not the job; a search does that in a second. The job is the breakage a search does not show.

## The proof ladder

A write-up that sounds right proves nothing. For each fact the change depends on, climb as far as is cheap and say where you stopped:

1. **Said.** Your belief. Worth nothing alone.
2. **Pointed.** A real `file:line`, in this repo or in the library's own source.
3. **Walked.** You followed the bad case step by step and it cannot happen.
4. **Ran.** A small script or test calls the real code and fails loudly if you are wrong.
5. **Reproduced.** You saw it in the running app.

Step 4 is usually a short script that imports the same library at the same version and calls the exact function in doubt. Keep it outside the repository.

## Steps

1. **Read the change.** What it adds, changes and deletes, and what it now does differently, including what the diff does not spell out.
2. **Find the one fact.** Most risky-looking changes are safe because of a single fact, such as "this only drops cache entries that are already dead". If it holds, most risks fall with it. Spend your time here.
3. **Look where search stops.** The library's code at the installed version. When things run: teardown, queues, timers, retries. What symbol search misses: the JSON an API returns, a database column, a message another service reads, an environment variable, a feature flag, code three calls away.
4. **Weigh each risk honestly.** A real chance and a real cost for each. Keep confirmed risks apart from the ones you checked and cleared. A search that finds nothing is an answer too; never invent a caller.
5. **Prove the fact.** Write the script, run it, paste the output.

## Hand back

- **What changes**, including the non-obvious part.
- **The fact that makes it safe**, the rung it reached, and the proof. If you could not prove it, write "unproven".
- **Risks:** how each breaks, `file:line`, chance and cost, how to check.
- **Cleared:** what you checked and why it is fine.
- **Before merging:** the cheapest test or reproduction that catches the real failure.
